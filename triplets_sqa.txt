Note: The provided traits do not match the aurochs. Based on the examples given in the instruction, these traits are from different fossils (spiral shell, small leaves, walking on land). A more accurate trait for an aurochs fossil might be "large size" or "horns," but since those were not provided, I have used the given examples to illustrate the format. If you could provide specific traits observed in an aurochs fossil, I can adjust the triplets accordingly.
